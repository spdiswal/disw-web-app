= DISW Web App

This repository contains the app for web browsers.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js], version 16 or newer.
* https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install[Yarn], which you can install with npm:
+
----
npm install -g yarn
----

Recommended plugins for IntelliJ IDEA users:

* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[AsciiDoc]
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15321-tailwind-css[Tailwind CSS]

Recommended browser extensions:

* https://preactjs.github.io/preact-devtools/[Preact Devtools]

=== Cloning the Repository
For IntelliJ IDEA users:

. Clone the Git repository onto your local computer: menu:Welcome[Get from VCS] or menu:Git[Clone].
. Open the project folder into which you cloned the repository:
menu:File[Open].

=== Installing Third-Party Dependencies
This project uses the https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs[zero-install feature] of the Yarn package manager.
Upon cloning the Git repository, the `.yarn/cache` folder contains a cache of most third-party dependencies already, effectively replacing the usual `node_modules` folder.

However, a few dependencies (usually executable binaries) remain _unplugged_.
They must be installed explicitly by executing this command from the project root folder:

----
yarn install
----

=== Defining a Profile
A profile describes the content to display in the web app.

The `VITE_PROFILE_NAME` environment variable specifies the profile to use.
It is defined in `.env.development`.

You can create a new profile (e.g. named `my-profile`):

. In the `main/profile/content` folder, save the portrait as a https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/using[WebP] image file named `my-profile.webp`.
. In the same folder, create a TypeScript file named `my-profile.ts` and import the portrait:
+
----
import portraitAssetUrl from "./my-profile.webp"
----
. Export a constant named `content` of the `Content` type, in which you describe the content and set the portrait.
. In the project root folder, create a new file named `.env.development.local` (or `.env.production.local` when building for production).
Git will ignore this file.
Let it override the `VITE_PROFILE_NAME` environment variable to use the new profile:
+
----
VITE_PROFILE_NAME=my-profile
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Git will ignore filenames that contain the substring `.local`.
Use this to prevent personal information from leaking into the repository.

For example: `my-profile.local.ts` and `my-profile.local.webp`.

You must override the `VITE_PROFILE_NAME` environment variable accordingly:

----
VITE_PROFILE_NAME=my-profile.local
----
====

== Common Work Tasks
This section describes the scripts to execute for carrying out certain daily work tasks.
You should execute these scripts from the project root folder.
They have been defined in the `scripts` field in `package.json`.

=== Starting a Development Server
To start a development server that hosts the web app under construction at http://localhost:5000:

----
yarn run develop
----

Equipped with hot module replacement (HMR), it reflects any changes you make immediately in the web browser.

[#_validating_the_software_quality]
=== Validating the Software Quality
To validate the quality of the software:

----
yarn run validate
----

It runs the following means of validation:

* Type checking via TypeScript.
* Static program analysis (linting) via ESLint.
* Automated unit testing via Jest.

You can apply an automated fix of certain issues reported by ESLint:

----
yarn run validate:lint:fix
----

=== Building for Production
To make a production-grade distribution of the web app:

----
yarn run build
----

It saves the output in the `build/www` folder.

<<_validating_the_software_quality>> must pass before it attempts to build the distribution.

After building the distribution, you can start a web server that hosts a preview at http://localhost:80:

----
yarn run build:preview
----

== Tools

=== Third-Party Dependencies
Following the Node.js convention, this project distinguishes between _runtime_ dependencies and _development_ dependencies.
The `dependencies` and `devDependencies` fields in `package.json` declare these two sets of dependencies, respectively.

[TIP]
====
When a dependency is imported by the source code or declares values in the global namespace, it is a runtime dependency.

For example, `preact` is imported by `main-client.tsx` and `tailwindcss` defines globally accessible CSS properties, which are imported indirectly by `main-client.tsx` via `index.css`.
====

Use the custom `dependenciesComments` and `devDependenciesComments` fields to associate each dependency to a maintenance comment or a description that justifies its use in this project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For security reasons, *always specify the exact version* of a dependency in `package.json`.

Avoid using the `^` and `~` modifiers, which would otherwise allow the package manager to install a newer minor or patch version of the dependency than the one specified.
====

=== Preact
https://preactjs.com/[Preact] is a reactive web UI framework with an API similar to that of React.
It lets you define components as JavaScript functions using https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html[JSX].

[CAUTION]
====
The JSX dialect of Preact is slightly different from React.

For historical reasons, most tools support JSX transformations for React, compiling JSX to function calls of `React.createElement` by default.

However, in Preact, the factory function is `h` (also known as https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript[hyperscript]).
====

For IntelliJ IDEA users:

. Open the inspection settings: *File* &rsaquo; *Settings* &rsaquo; *Editor* &rsaquo; *Inspections*.
. Disable the warning from this inspection: *JavaScript and TypeScript* &rsaquo; *Imports and dependencies* &rsaquo; _Missing 'React' namespace import in JSX code_.

=== Tailwind CSS
https://tailwindcss.com/[Tailwind CSS] is a utility-first CSS framework.
It encourages the developer to reuse styles by extracting components (e.g. via Preact) rather than defining CSS rules and abstractions as practised in traditional CSS development.

`tailwind.config.cjs` defines the https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration[configuration] of the Tailwind CSS environment.

NOTE: The `.cjs` file extension indicates that the JavaScript file follows the CommonJS module standard of Node.js instead of the modern ECMAScript module standard (ESM).
The latter is usually indicated by the `.mjs` file extension.

=== PostCSS
https://postcss.org/[PostCSS] is a processing tool for CSS.
Among other things, it permits the use of CSS syntax extensions such as the `@tailwind` and `@apply` directives from Tailwind CSS.

`postcss.config.cjs` defines the configuration of PostCSS as https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#generating-a-post-css-configuration-file[recommended] by the Tailwind CSS documentation.

=== TypeScript
https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] is a programming language that extends JavaScript with syntax for static typing.

`tsconfig.json` defines the https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig[configuration] of the TypeScript environment, except for the set of globally visible types which `global.d.ts` defines.

=== Vite
https://vitejs.dev/[Vite] is a frontend build tool.
It hosts the development server and generates the distribution of the web app for production.

`vite.config.ts` defines the https://vitejs.dev/config/[configuration] of Vite.
It picks up the PostCSS configuration in `postcss.config.cjs` automatically.

[CAUTION]
====
You can define the configurations of PostCSS and Tailwind CSS directly in the Vite configuration file.

However, doing so would prevent Vite from instantly applying configuration changes, particularly in Tailwind CSS themes, without requiring a restart of the development server.
====

To load the correct profile into the web app, the Vite configuration defines `+profile/content/predefined` to be an alias for the TypeScript module designated by `VITE_PROFILE_NAME`.

Generating a production-grade distribution of the web app consists of two phases:

. A *server-oriented build* which produces a CommonJS module that generates static HTML from the initial state of the web app.
The entry point is `main-server.tsx`.
Vite operates in `ssr` mode during this phase.

. A *client-oriented build* which pre-renders the HTML page and produces a browser script that makes the web app interactive.
The entry point is `index.html`, which in turn imports `main-client.tsx`.
Vite operates in its normal mode during this phase.
Additionally, the Vite configuration imports the CommonJS module produced by the server-oriented build to complete pre-rendering the HTML page at build-time.

[NOTE]
====
_Pre-Rendering_, also known as _Static Site Generation_ (SSG), is a technique in which a static HTML page is generated at build-time.

_Server-Side Rendering_ (SSR) is a slightly different technique in which the HTML page is generated dynamically by the web server at request-time.
Both techniques allow search engines to discover the contents of the web app without having to execute any browser scripts.
====

If you need to debug the _production-grade distribution_, you can set the `VITE_DEBUG_PRODUCTION_BUILD` environment variable to be `true` in `.env.production.local`.
This enables Preact debugging tools on runtime and skips minification of the build artifacts.

=== Jest
https://jestjs.io/[Jest] is a unit testing framework for JavaScript.
It is independent of Vite and does not inherit any of its capabilities.

`jest.config.cjs` defines the https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration[configuration] of Jest.
It relies on the `ts-jest` transformer to support TypeScript and Preact-compatible JSX transformations via `tsconfig.json`.

=== ESLint
https://eslint.org/[ESLint] is a static program analysis tool that flags issues in the source code.

`.eslintrc.cjs` defines the https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/[configuration] of ESLint, including the set of rules to be enforced.
Every rule must be set to either `error` or `off`.
We do not use the `warning` level, which would only pollute the linting report while allowing rules to be violated without interrupting the build step.

It uses https://typescript-eslint.io/[TypeScript ESLint] to parse TypeScript sources and perform type-aware analysis according to `tsconfig.json`.

=== AsciiDoc
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc] is a markup language for writing documentation.
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/[AsciiDoctor] is a processing tool that converts AsciiDoc files to various output formats such as HTML and PDF.

No configuration is needed for accessing the AsciiDoc documentation files in plain text.

IntelliJ IDEA users with the AsciiDoc plugin may https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/docs/users-guide/features/advanced/stylesheets.html[customise the HTML preview] by providing a stylesheet:

. In the project root folder, create a new folder named `.asciidoctor`.
Git will ignore this folder.
. Copy your stylesheet (e.g. `my-preview-stylesheet.css`) into the `.asciidoctor` folder.
. In the project root folder, create a new file named `.asciidoctorconfig`.
Git will ignore this file.
Insert this content into the file to apply the stylesheet:
+
----
:experimental:
:stylesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/.asciidoctor/
:stylesheet: my-preview-stylesheet.css
----

[CAUTION]
====
The configuration file and the stylesheet *should not* be checked into the Git repository.

By refraining from doing so, developers may provide their own stylesheet to suit their preference, for example to match a light or a dark theme in IntelliJ IDEA.
